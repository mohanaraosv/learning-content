A nano project to start a Vaadin project running in a Jakarta EE 8 Container, based on Apache TomEE.

== Target of this project

The target of this project is a minimal rampup time for a first hello world.
Why we need one more HelloWorld? Well, the answer is quite easy.
If you have to try something out, or you want to make a small POC to present something,
there is no time and budget to create a demo project.
You don't want to copy paste all small things together.
Here you will get a HelloWorld-Project that will give you all in a second.

link:https://github.com/vaadin-learning-center/flow-helloworld-maven-meecrowave[Clone the repo] and start editing the class `VaadinApp`.
Nothing more. 

== Used Servlet container?
Here we are using the Jakarta EE 8 server **TomEE** as Servlet-Container.
http://tomee.apache.org/[http://tomee.apache.org/]
If you want to use Vaadin together with CDI, have a look at the CDI starter. This is 
using TomEE together with the CDI AddOn. 
You can find the starter at https://vaadin.com/start/latest/project-base-cdi[https://vaadin.com/start/latest/project-base-cdi]

== The UI itself

The UI itself contains not so many elements. There is only a button you can click.
For every click, the counter will be increased.
The component will be registered under the root-path, based on the Annotation `@Route("")`
For more information's about the routing itself have a look at
https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/routing/tutorial-routing-annotation.html[https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/routing/tutorial-routing-annotation.html]

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class VaadinApp extends Composite<Div> {

  private final Button         btnClickMe   = new Button("click me");
  private final Span           lbClickCount = new Span("0");
  private final VerticalLayout layout       = new VerticalLayout(btnClickMe, lbClickCount);

  private int clickcount = 0;

  public VaadinApp() {
    btnClickMe.addClickListener(event -> lbClickCount.setText(valueOf(++clickcount)));
    //set the main Component
    System.out.println("setting now the main ui content..");
    getContent().add(layout);

  }
}
----

== Maven dependencies
To use this together with a Jakarta EE 8 Container you should add
first the corresponding specifications, or better interfaces. For this
the following dependency were added to this project. Make sure you will add it with the scope
**provided**. The container will have its own version provided during runtime.

[source,xml]
----
      <dependency>
        <groupId>javax</groupId>
        <artifactId>javaee-api</artifactId>
        <version>8.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
      </dependency>
----

The definition about the used container is provided via maven plugin.

[source,xml]
----
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.tomee.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>tomee-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${tomee.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <tomeeClassifier>webprofile</tomeeClassifier>
          <context>ROOT</context>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
----

== How to start it
With this plugin the demo could be started.
Try the following maven command inside the folder that was created from git during the clone process.

```mvn clean install tomee:run ```

After the demo was build from scratch, maven got all dependencies from maven central and Apache TomEE was started,
you are able to try the webapp on http://localhost:8080/[http://localhost:8080/]


Happy Coding.
