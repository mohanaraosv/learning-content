In this part we will have a look at the layout mechanism itself and how you could
build more complex layouts structures.

== Download base project
As "Hello World" basic project the `flow-helloworld-maven-meecrowave`
from the learning center is used.
You are able to find the latest version
here: https://github.com/vaadin-learning-center/flow-helloworld-maven-meecrowave[https://github.com/vaadin-learning-center/flow-helloworld-maven-meecrowave]

== The challenge
How to define elements in your application that are needed everywhere
like a MenuBar?

=== Preparations for this tutorial
First we are creating a view Views that we want to
extend with some generic elements like a menubar.

For this two classes are additionally created in this project.
The names of this classes are `ViewA` and `ViewB`.
In total we have three classes that are representing a View now.

The classes are all extending the class `Composite<Div>` and the root element inside the Composite is
a neutral div itself. If you want to read more about this, have a look at
the documentation at: https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/creating-components/tutorial-component-composite.html 

Every View class will get an annotation `Route` for an individual path.
For example the class `ViewA` will get a path called `ViewA`. To access this view you have to go
to http://localhost:8080/ViewA[http://localhost:8080/ViewA]

The same for the class called `ViewB`, the path will be `ViewB`

.`*views/ViewA.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Route(value = "ViewA")
public class ViewA extends Composite<Div> {

  public ViewA() {
    getContent().add(new Span("ViewA"));
  }
}
----

The class itself will do nothing exciting. It will only write the view name itself on screen.
For sure the navigation between the views is not very comfortable for the user.
We need a menu bar, containing all links to all accessible views.


=== The menu bar
A good place for a menu bar is inside a layout, based on the idea that a layout is the generic structure of the
ui. The menu bar itself contains only three elements for this example.


.`*views/LayoutWithMenuBar.java*`
[source,java]
----
  private final HorizontalLayout menuBar = new HorizontalLayout(
      new RouterLink("ViewA" , ViewA.class) ,
      new RouterLink("ViewB" , ViewB.class) ,
      new RouterLink("Home" , VaadinApp.class)
  );
----

But what is the right place for this peace of code? Having in mind, that this will be used
all the time. For this wa are creating a class with the name `LayoutWithMenuBar`.
This is again a Composite of Type Div. Inside this class the needed menu structure will be created.

.`*views/LayoutWithMenuBar.java*`
[source,java]
----
public class LayoutWithMenuBar extends Composite<Div> {

  private final Div content = new Div();

  private final HorizontalLayout menuBar = new HorizontalLayout(
      new RouterLink("ViewA" , ViewA.class) ,
      new RouterLink("ViewB" , ViewB.class) ,
      new RouterLink("Home" , VaadinApp.class)
  );

  private final VerticalLayout root = new VerticalLayout(menuBar, content);

  public LayoutWithMenuBar() {
    getContent().add(root);
  }
}
----

Important is the holder for the part that should be wrapped. Here it is of type
`Div` and called `content`. But how to make a Layout out of this? Who will set the content and
how this should be done?

For this Vaadin/Flow will give you the interface `RouterLayout` to implement.
The important method to override is `public void showRouterLayoutContent(HasElement hasElement)`

This method will be invoked by the framework and will get the Element that should be wrapped.
The logic to implement is easy, because it should only set the
actual content and must make sure the old one is removed.


.`*layout/LayoutWithMenuBar.java*`
[source,java]
----
public class LayoutWithMenuBar extends Composite<Div> implements RouterLayout{

  //.. removed some lines for readibility

  @Override
  public void showRouterLayoutContent(HasElement hasElement) {
    System.out.println("showRouterLayoutContent - LayoutWithMenuBar");
    Objects.requireNonNull(hasElement);
    Objects.requireNonNull(hasElement.getElement());
    content.removeAll();
    content.getElement().appendChild(hasElement.getElement());
  }
}
----

But how to use this Layout now? The connection between the View and the Layout
is done by the annotation called `@Route(value = "ViewA", layout = LayoutWithMenuBar.class)`
The attribute `layout` must be set with the class of the layout itself.

=== How to nest layouts?
Now we are able to use the layout we are created.
But having in mind, that a complex layout will be build up from different parts, we need a way to build a
composition of layout-elements. Each layout element should be independent in an ideal world.

To show this we want to add two messages on the screen. One on the top, one at the bottom.
This itself is easy done. We are creating a class with the name `MainLayout` and doing the same we have done before.
We are building a generic layout and there is no hint that there will be a menu bar.


.`*layout/MainLayout.java*`
[source,java]
----
public class MainLayout extends Composite<Div> implements RouterLayout , HasLogger {

  //Component to delegate content through.
  private Div content = new Div();

  private final VerticalLayout layout = new VerticalLayout(
      new Span("from MainLayout top") ,
      content ,
      new Span("from MainLayout bottom")
  );

  public MainLayout() {
    getContent().add(layout);
  }

  @Override
  public void showRouterLayoutContent(HasElement hasElement) {
    System.out.println("showRouterLayoutContent - MainLayout");
    Objects.requireNonNull(hasElement);
    Objects.requireNonNull(hasElement.getElement());
    content.removeAll();
    content.getElement().appendChild(hasElement.getElement());
  }
}
----

But how we could nest them? The key is the Annotation called `@ParentLayout(value = MainLayout.class)`
Here we are able to define who is the wrapper around myself. This annotation must be used
at the child Layout, here `LayoutWithMenuBar` Now the framework is able to create the
hierarchy of layout instances. ThatÂ´s it.

== All together
Finally we will have a look the hole thing itself.
The View will be annotated with the latest child of the layout hierarchy, here `LayoutWithMenuBar`


.`*views/MainLayout.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Route(value = "ViewA", layout = LayoutWithMenuBar.class)
public class ViewA extends Composite<Div> {

  public ViewA() {
    getContent().add(new Span("ViewA"));
  }
}
----

The class `LayoutWithMenuBar` will be connected with the `MainLayout` via the annotation `ParentLayout`

.`*layout/LayoutWithMenuBar.java*`
[source,java]
----
@ParentLayout(value = MainLayout.class)
public class LayoutWithMenuBar extends Composite<Div> implements RouterLayout , HasLogger {

  private final Div content = new Div();

  private final HorizontalLayout menuBar = new HorizontalLayout(
      new RouterLink("ViewA" , ViewA.class) ,
      new RouterLink("ViewB" , ViewB.class) ,
      new RouterLink("Home" , VaadinApp.class)
  );

  private final VerticalLayout root = new VerticalLayout(menuBar, content);

  public LayoutWithMenuBar() {
    getContent().add(root);
  }

  @Override
  public void showRouterLayoutContent(HasElement hasElement) {
    System.out.println("showRouterLayoutContent - LayoutWithMenuBar");
    Objects.requireNonNull(hasElement);
    Objects.requireNonNull(hasElement.getElement());
    content.removeAll();
    content.getElement().appendChild(hasElement.getElement());
  }
}
----

The class `MainLayout` is the parent of the application layout and the place where you can define the Theme
that should be used by the app.

.`*layout/MainLayout.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Theme(value = Lumo.class, variant = Lumo.LIGHT)
public class MainLayout extends Composite<Div> implements RouterLayout , HasLogger {

  //Component to delegate content through.
  private Div content = new Div();

  private final VerticalLayout layout = new VerticalLayout(
      new Span("from MainLayout top") ,
      content ,
      new Span("from MainLayout bottom")
  );

  public MainLayout() {
    getContent().add(layout);
  }

  @Override
  public void showRouterLayoutContent(HasElement hasElement) {
    System.out.println("showRouterLayoutContent - MainLayout");
    Objects.requireNonNull(hasElement);
    Objects.requireNonNull(hasElement.getElement());
    content.removeAll();
    content.getElement().appendChild(hasElement.getElement());
  }
}
----


== Finally
Finally we have all things together we need to build a complete layout
based on composition of independent layout implementations.
The only thing that will bind all of them together is the annotation `ParentLayout`
