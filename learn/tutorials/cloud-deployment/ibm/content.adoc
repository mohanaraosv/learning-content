This tutorial shows how to deploy a Java web application to IBM Cloud. You can upload a Cloud foundry application to IBM Cloud for free. More details on the IBM web page https://www.ibm.com/cloud/free.

You can deploy the application directly from your command line or from a GitHub repository as a CI pipeline. Skip to “Option 2” after the prerequisites, if you prefer to only set up the latter.

I’m using the latest LTS (Vaadin 14 at the time of writing) starter app as an example. You can download the app from https://vaadin.com/start if you don’t have your own app to deploy.

== Prerequisites:

=== Prepare your Vaadin application

. Go to the Vaadin website (vaadin.com).
+
image::vaadin_website.png[vaadin website]
+
. Click on *GET STARTED*.
+
image::download_starter.png[download starter]
+
. Pick any of the three technology stacks, download the project and follow the instructions on the right to import the Vaadin project into your IDE (e.g. Eclipse).
. Once you have imported your project you will need to build it in production mode (i.e. run `mvn clean package -Pproduction`). For more details please have a look at https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/production/tutorial-production-mode-basic.html.

At this point your Vaadin project is ready to run on a Websphere or Tomcat Server.

=== Sign up for a free IBM account

You need an IBMid to create a Cloud Foundry Organization and space.

To create an IBMid:

. Go to https://myibm.ibm.com and click on *Create an IBMid*.
+
image::ibm_login.png[ibm login]
+
. Create your IBMid by filling in the details.
+
image::create_ibm_account.png[create ibm account]
+
. Then use your IBMid to sign in on IBM Cloud at https://cloud.ibm.com.
+
image::IBM_cloud_login.png[ibmid login]
+
NOTE: You can deploy 1 CF (Cloud Foundry Application) with a free account.

To create a CF Organization and space:

. select *Manage* *→* *Account*.
+
image::manage_account.png[manage account]
+
. Click on *Cloud Foundry Orgs* in the *Account* window.
. Create a Cloud Foundry organization (e.g. “Vaadin14”) and a space (e.g. “dev”) in one of the regions listed (e.g. “US South”). Note that the Cloud Foundry organization name must be unique.
+

When you return to your IBM Cloud Dashboard you should be able to see the Cloud Foundry Organization and its space(s).

image::resource_list.png[resource list]

Please note that you can do these steps alternatively by using CF or IBM Cloud CLI only, e.g. you might use following CF CLI commands to login to the region US South and create an organization and space:

`cf login -a api.us-south.cf.cloud.ibm.com`

`cf create-org *your_cf_organization_name*`

`cf create-space *your_cf_space_name*`

To install Cloud Foundry CLI please visit https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html.


== Option 1: Deploy from command line

This is for uploading a `.jar` directly onto IBM Cloud. Skip to the next section if you wish to deploy from GitHub.
You can either use the default Cloud Foundry CLI or the IBM Cloud CLI to push your application.

=== Login to IBM Cloud with CF or IBM Cloud CLI

To install IBM Cloud CLI please visit https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli.

This tutorial uses the CF CLI. In case you want to use IBM Cloud CLI, simply add ibmcloud before the cf commands once you are logged in. For logging in, please use the `ibmcloud login` command and follow instructions to select region and cf organization. 

In this example, our Cloud Foundry space is located in the region "US South". The IBM Cloud endpoint for US South region is “api.us-south.cf.cloud.ibm.com”. To lookup endpoints for other regions, please visit https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-endpoints#api-endpoint-options.

----

NOTE: For Oauth login you need to use:  `cf login -a *the_endpoint_address* -sso` and follow the instructions.

Once you are logged in you are ready for the final step before pushing your application: Creating a  `manifest.yml` file.

=== Create a manifest.yml file

. Navigate to the root folder of your Vaadin project and create a new file `manifest.yml`. Open the `manifest.yml` file and enter your desired application name, number of instances you want to deploy, amount of memory you want to provide for each instance, the cloud foundry buildpack you want to use and the path to your `.war` or `.jar` file similar as shown below:
+
image::manifest.png[manifest file]
+
Please note that you can give less than 2G memory for your application, i.e. 528M. Once you are done you can proceed to the final step to deploy your application on IBM Cloud.

=== Push your Vaadin application to IBM Cloud

Navigate to the root folder of your Vaadin project and run the `cf push` command:

----
 
You can check the status of your Cloud Foundry applications with the `cf apps` command, stop an application with the `cf stop *application_name*` command or delete it with `cf delete *application_name*`.

To see the recent logs, use `cf logs *application_name* -–recent` or use `cf logs *application_name*` to view logs in real time.

NOTE: Replace each instance of `*application_name*` with the name you provided for you application.

== Option 2: Set up a continuous deployment pipeline

This is an alternative way to deploy your application which will allow you to push updates to it directly from your git repository.

=== Provision a CD service

. Provision a Continuous Delivery service on IBM Cloud by clicking on *Catalog* and selecting the service.
+
image::provision_cd.png[provision a cd]
+
TIP: You can also use the search field to find the service you are looking for.
+
. When you provision your Continuous Delivery service, you might want to make sure that your location is the same as the location of your CF Organization’s space.
+
In this tutorial "Dallas" (i.e. "US South") has been selected.
+
image::region.png[region selection]

=== Create a Toolchain

Once you have provisioned a Continuous Delivery service you will need to create a Toolchain for it.

You can create a Toolchain by:

. Selecting your Continuous Delivery service from *Resource List* on *Dashboard* and clicking on *Getting Started*.
+
image::toolchain_start.png[toolchain getting started]
+
. At this point you will have the option to create a toolchain or view existing toolchains. Click on *view existing toolchains* (or click on *create a toolchain* if you want to skip the overview of toolchains).
+
image::toolchains_view.png[toolchains view]
+
TIP: If you haven’t created a dedicated "Resource Group" for your project, you can create one by visiting your *Dashboard (IBM Cloud)* *→* *Manage* *→* *Account* *→* *Resource Groups*.
+
. Next, you will be able to pick the "Resource Group" and the "Location" for your toolchain. Click on *Create toolchain*.
+
image::create_toolchain.png[create toolchain]
+
. Scroll down the page until you see *Other templates*.
+
image::templates.png[toolchain templates]
+
. Select *Build your own toolchain*.
+
image::build_toolchain.png[build toolchain]
+
. Give your toolchain a name, select a region, a resource group and click on *Create*.

=== Configure tools
image::add_tool.png[add tool]

You will need two tools: “Git Repos and Issue Tracking” -which is a Gitlab clone on IBM Cloud- and “Delivery Pipeline”.

image::tools.png[tools]

. First, add the git repository and make sure that *Track deployment of code changes* is checked.
+
image::add_git.png[add git]
+
. You can provision a private git repository on IBM Cloud for free. Next you need to provision a *Delivery Pipeline*.
+
image::configure_pipeline.png[configure pipeline]
+
After provisioning both tools, your toolchain should be looking like this:
+
image::toolchain.png[toolchain]

=== Deploy your application

Now, you need to push your Vaadin 14 project to the git repository.

. Right-click to open the *Git* tool in a new tab and follow the instructions.
. After pushing your project, return to the tab of your toolchain and click on the *Delivery Pipeline* tool. 
. You will need to create a new “Stage”.
The “Input” of the Stage will be automatically filled with information from the Git repository you added to your toolchain. Make sure that you configure the “Build” Job as shown below and save. This will be your “BuildStage”.
+
image::build_stage.png[build stage]
+
Here is the Deploy script:
+
----
#!/bin/bash
mvn -B package -Pproduction
cp manifest.yml target/manifest.yml
cd target
echo $(pwd)
echo $(ls)
----
+
. Next you need to create a new stage “DeployStage”. The input will be automatically configured as Build artifacts from the previous stage. Configure the “Deploy” Job similar as shown below:
+
image::deploy_stage.png[deploy]
+
Here is the Deploy script:
+
----
#!/bin/bash
echo $(pwd)
echo $(ls)
 
if [ -d "target" ]; then
  echo "target directory already exists..."
else
  mkdir target
  echo "Created target directory..."
fi

cp my-starter-project-plain-java-servlet-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war target
cf push
----
+
. Finally, click on the *Play* icon and run the stage.
+
image::run_stage.png[run stage]
+
After successful deployment when you click on *View console* you will be forwarded to deployment page of the application, where you can check its status:
+
image::application_status.png[application status]
+
Clicking on *Visit App URL* will show you the app’s website:
+
