In this tutorial, we learn how to build a reactive chat application. The backend consists of a Spring Boot Application, reactive data types from Project Reactor, and Vaadin for the UI layer.

== Downloading the starter project

Start by going to https://vaadin.com/start/latest/project-base-spring[]. You can leave the group id and name as they are unless you want to change them. 

.Vaadin Spring starter download page

The application is a Maven project that extends the Spring Boot starter project and adds some example Vaadin code. 

Once downloaded, unzip the project and open it up in your editor of choice. 

== Add Project Reactor dependency
Before we can start, we need to add a dependency to Project Reactor for the reactive data types.

In the `<dependencies>`-section of `pom.xml`, add the following dependency:

.`*pom.xml*`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

== Delete unneeded code

Delete `MessageBean.java`, and clean out all the code from the `MainView` constructor, so we have a clean slate to start from. 

.`*MainVew.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Route
@PWA(name = "Vaadin Chat", shortName = "Vaadin Chat")
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

  public MainView() {
    // Delete all code from here
  }
}
----

== Set up main layout and header

By default, a `VerticalLayout` is only as big as the content in it requires. We need to make the main layout _full size_ so that we can put the message input layout all the way at the bottom. We also want to center all the content. 

Also, add a header and a class name so we can style it with CSS. 

.`*MainVew.java*`
[source,java]
----
@CssImport("./styles/styles.css")
public MainView() {
  setSizeFull();
  setDefaultHorizontalComponentAlignment(Alignment.CENTER);
  addClassName("main-view");

  H1 header = new H1("Vaadin Chat");
  header.getElement().getThemeList().add("dark"); <1>

  add(header);
}
----
<1> The `dark` theme variant will give the heading a dark background and light text.

Then, create a new CSS file for the styles:

.`*frontend/styles/styles.css*`
[source,css]
----
.main-view h1 {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 16px;
  width: 100%;
}
----

Run the Spring Boot application. You can do this either by right-clicking on `Application.java` and selecting "Run," or by running `mvn spring-boot:run` in the terminal. Spring Boot devtools will monitor for changes as you compile the project.

Open your browser to `localhost:8080`. You should see the following:

== Signing in
With the header in place, the next thing we need is to identify the person that opens the application. 

In the `MainView` constructor, call `askUsername()` and implement the method underneath.

.`*MainVew.java*`
[source,java]
----
public MainView() {
  // omitted
  askUsername();
}

private void askUsername() {
  HorizontalLayout layout = new HorizontalLayout();
  TextField usernameField = new TextField();
  Button startButton = new Button("Start chat");
  layout.add(usernameField, startButton);
  add(layout);
}
----

Notice that we wrap the text field and button in a `HorizontalLayout` to place them next to each other. Then, we add that layout to the main `VerticalLayout`. 

Next, add a click listener on the button to collect the username. 

.`*MainVew.java*`
[source,java]
----
private String username; <1>

private void askUsername() {
  // omitted
  startButton.addClickListener(click -> {
    username = usernameField.getValue();
    remove(layout);
    showChat();
  });
}

private void showChat() {

}
----
<1> Define the `username` field at the top of the file.

The listener saves the value of the username text field into a field on `MainLayout`, removes the layout, and finally calls `showChat`.

Build the application, and you should now see this in your browser. If you click the button, you should notice the layout disappear.

== Build a custom component for the message list
We need to create a custom component to handle the message list. We need it to be able to scroll when the number of messages exceeds the available space. We also want to have the latest message scrolled into view on updates.

.`*MessageList.java*`
[source,java]
----
public class MessageList extends Div {

  public MessageList() {
    addClassName("message-list");
  }

  @Override
  public void add(Component... components) {
    super.add(components); <1>

    components[components.length-1]
        .getElement() <2>
        .callFunction("scrollIntoView"); <3>
  }
}
----
<1> Let the parent take care of adding the components.
<2> Get the last added component and call `getElement` to get a handle to its DOM element.
<3> Use `callFunction` to call the JavaScript function `scrollIntoView` on the element. 

Then, add the following to the stylesheet to enable scrolling. 

.`*styles.css*`
[source,css]
----
.message-list {
    overflow-y: scroll;
    width: 100%;
}

.message-list p {
    width: 100%;
}
----

== Build the main layout
Now that we have a component that can handle a long list of chat messages, we are ready to build the main chat layout. 

.`*MainVew.java*`
[source,java]
----
private void showChat() {
  MessageList messageList = new MessageList();
  add(messageList, createInputLayout());
}

private Component createInputLayout() {
  HorizontalLayout layout = new HorizontalLayout();

  TextField messageField = new TextField();
  Button sendButton = new Button("Send");
  sendButton.addThemeVariants(ButtonVariant.LUMO_PRIMARY); <1>

  layout.add(messageField, sendButton);
  return layout;
}
----
<1> The `LUMO_PRIMARY` theme variant for the button makes it more visually distinct to help users understand its the primary action. 

If you build the app and refresh your browser, you should now see this:

image::main-layout-unfinished.png[Unfinished main layout]

Although we have all the components visible, they still need some tweaking.

== Use expand to allocate size between components
Vaadin layouts have a `expand` method that can be used to instruct it how to allocate space to its children. If you call `expand` on one component in a layout, it will grow to take up all the space in a layout that is not needed by other components.  

.`*MainVew.java*`
[source,java]
----
private void showChat() {
  // omitted
  expand(messageList);
}
private Component createInputLayou() {
  // omitted
  layout.setWidth("100%");
  layout.expand(messageField);
  return layout;
}
----

Build and run the app, and you should now see the correct layout.

== Reactive backend for handling the messages
The UI is now built as far as we can build it without having a backend. 

Start off by creating a new file, `ChatMessage.java`, as the data object for a single chat message.

.`*ChatMessage.java*`
[source,java]
----
class ChatMessage {
  private String from;
  private String message;

  ChatMessage(String from, String message) {
    this.from = from;
    this.message = message;
  }

  String getFrom() {
    return from;
  }
  
  String getMessage() {
    return message;
  }
}
----

Then, open `Application` and declare two beans:

.`*ChatMessage.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Bean
UnicastProcessor<ChatMessage> publisher(){
    return UnicastProcessor.create();
}
@Bean
Flux<ChatMessage> messages(UnicastProcessor<ChatMessage> publisher) {
    return publisher.replay(30).autoConnect();
}
----

The `UnicastProcessor` is the central place to which all clients will post their messages. 

The `Flux` listens to that `UnicastProcessor`, buffering the last 30 messages, and can be subscribed to by all connected clients. 

To use these, we need to autowire them into `MainView`. Modify the constructor to take them as parameters, and bind them to fields.

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
private final UnicastProcessor<ChatMessage> publisher;
private final Flux<ChatMessage> messages;

public MainView(UnicastProcessor<ChatMessage> publisher,
                Flux<ChatMessage> messages) {
  this.publisher = publisher;
  this.messages = messages;
  //omitted
}
//omitted
----

We now have all the backend code we need to continue building the UI.

== Send messages
Go back into `createInputLayout` in `MainLayout` and add a listener to the send button. The listener should create a new `ChatMessage` object and pass it to `producer.onNext`.

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
sendButton.addClickListener(click -> {
  publisher.onNext(new ChatMessage(username, messageField.getValue()));
  messageField.clear();
  messageField.focus();
});
messageField.focus();
----

In addition to sending the message, clear out and focus the input field so that the user can continue writing their next message without having to clear out the input themselves.

== Receive messages
Now that we're able to send messages, the next step is to listen for incoming messages and displaying them. In the `showChat` method, subscribe to the `messages` flux, and append each message to the `MessageList` component we created earlier. 

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
messages.subscribe(message -> {
  messageList.add(
    new Paragraph(message.getFrom() + ": " +
                  message.getMessage()))
});
----

== Use websockets for two way communication
The final thing we need to take care of is sending messages out to all clients. By default, Vaadin uses XHR requests for communication. This means that by default all interactions are initiated by the browser. In our case, we want the server to be able to push out new messages to all connected clients. We can do this by using a websocket to send and receive messages. 

Add a `@Push` annotation on the `MainView` class to instruct Vaadin to use a websocket. 

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Push
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {
----

Then, we need to assure Vaadin that we know what we're doing when we are updating the UI from an outside thread (messages from other users are triggered outside the normal request-response cycle of the user). We can do this by using the `access` helper on the main `UI` class. It takes in a `Command` and ensures safe concurrent access and that Vaadin updates the changes to the client. 

Change the message subscription in the `showChat` method to the following:

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
messages.subscribe(message -> {
  getUI().ifPresent(ui -> <1>
      ui.access(() -> <2>
          messageList.add(
              new Paragraph(message.getFrom() + ": " +
                  message.getMessage())
          )
      ));
});
----
<1> The UI getter returns an `Optional`. It may be empty if the component is not attached at the moment. In our case it will always be attached.
<2> Pass the message adding logic into the `access` method.

== Wrapup
Build the application and refresh your browser. You should now have a working chat application with a reactive backend and web socket support. Open a second window and try chatting with multiple participants.
