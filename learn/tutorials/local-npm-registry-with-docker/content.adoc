In this tutorial, we're going to show you how to avoid redundant downloads of npm dependencies while building Vaadin applications.

== Why does npm cause slow development turnaround times?

npm is the equivalent of Maven in the JavaScript environment. It manages the front-end dependencies for a Vaadin application. The packages will be downloaded during the build time and, depending on your environment, stored in a local repository. 

You have two options to set up npm. The first option is to install npm and Node globally. This will create a global repository and provide the packages across all your projects in a central location. The second option is to install npm locally with the https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin/[frontend-maven-plugin] and keep the dependencies in your project directory. You might want to opt for the second option if you don't have an npm installation or if you are on a test environment, which is deleted after completion.

To speed up the build process, we will cache all dependencies with a Docker image that is running a Nexus server on a local port and provide an npm registry.

== Installation

To install the npm registry with Docker, please do the following:

1. Install https://www.docker.com/[Docker].

2. Download the https://hub.docker.com/r/sebak/nexus_npm_registry_vaadin[docker-nexus-npm-registry image] from public https://registry.hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub Registry]

    $ docker pull sebak/nexus_npm_registry_vaadin

or, you can build an image from the given Dockerfile: 
   
    $ docker build -t="npm-registry" .


== Usage

    $ docker run -dit -p 8081:8081 npm-registry

To link npm to your local registry add a configuration to your local npm

    $ npm config set registry http://localhost:8081/repository/npmjs-org/

or add [frontend-maven-plugin](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin/) to your project pom. You can find an example project with a proper configuration in the vaadin-example folder.

After setting up the docker image, you need to compile a Vaadin project on your machine with 
    
    $ mvn install -Pproduction --file vaadin-example/pom.xml

TIP: You can add "-Dvaadin.version=&#60;vaadin version no.&#62;" to download the dependencies for a specific vaadin version. The available version numbers of the Vaadin framework can be found https://github.com/vaadin/platform/tags[here].

Note that you need to have an internet connection available if you want to add web components which are not part of the default web-component set to the project later.

To check the content of the npm registry, you can go to localhost:8081 and log in with username "admin" and password "admin."
