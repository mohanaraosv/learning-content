:description: How to start a Vaadin Flow project with Apache meecrowave in a second

A nano project to start a Vaadin project. Perfect for Micro-UIs packed as fat jar in a docker image.
This will be used in some of the tutorial implementations.

== Target of this project

The target of this project is a minimal rampup time for a first hello world.
Why we need one more HelloWorld? Well, the answer is quite easy.
If you have to try something out, or you want to make a small POC to present something,
there is no time and budget to create a demo project.
You don't want to copy paste all small things together.
Here you will get a HelloWorld-Project that will give you all in a second.

Clone the repo and start editing the class `VaadinApp` or `BasicTestUIRunner`.
Nothing more. 

== How does it work?

This project will not use any additional maven plugin or technology.

Here we are using the plain *meecrowave* as Servlet-Container.
http://openwebbeans.apache.org/meecrowave/index.html[http://openwebbeans.apache.org/meecrowave/index.html]

But let's start from the beginning.

== Start the Servlet-Container (Java)

The class `BasicTestUIRunner` will ramp up the Container.

Here all the basic stuff is done. The start will init. a ServletContainer at port `8080`.
If you want to use a random port, use `randomHttpPort()` instead of `setHttpPort(8080);`
The WebApp will deployed as `ROOT.war`. 

[source,java]
----
public class BasicTestUIRunner {
  private BasicTestUIRunner() {
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    new Meecrowave(new Meecrowave.Builder() {
      {
//        randomHttpPort();
        setHttpPort(8080);
        setTomcatScanning(true);
        setTomcatAutoSetup(false);
        setHttp2(true);
      }
    })
        .bake()
        .await();
  }
}
----

After this you can start the app invoking the main-method.

== The UI itself

The UI itself contains not so many elements. There is only a button you can click.
For every click, the counter will be increased.
The component will be registered under the root-path, based on the Annotation `@Route("")`
Form ore informations about the routing itself have a look at
https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/routing/tutorial-routing-annotation.html[https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/routing/tutorial-routing-annotation.html]

[source,java]
----
@Route("")
public class VaadinApp extends Composite<Div> {

  private final Button         btnClickMe   = new Button("click me");
  private final Span           lbClickCount = new Span("0");
  private final VerticalLayout layout       = new VerticalLayout(btnClickMe, lbClickCount);

  private int clickcount = 0;

  public VaadinApp() {
    btnClickMe.addClickListener(event -> lbClickCount.setText(valueOf(++clickcount)));

    //set the main Component
    System.out.println("setting now the main ui content..");
    getContent().add(layout);

  }
}

Happy Coding.
