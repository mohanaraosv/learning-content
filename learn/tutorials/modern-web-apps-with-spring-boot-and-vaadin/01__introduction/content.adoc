This guide is a *practical* introduction to web application development with Spring Boot and Vaadin.

It covers the entire development process, from setup to deployment, following a step-by-step approach. 
You can replicate each section at your own pace as you follow along. 

The content is suitable for anyone familiar with Java who wants to build a web application.
To make sure your development experience is enjoyable and productive, we start right from the beginning with setting up your development environment.

TIP: You can skip setting up a Java development environment and go ahead to link:/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin/vaadin-basics-components-and-layouts[chapter 4] if you prefer to code using an online IDE.

== What you'll learn

This guide teaches you how to build a functional, full-stack web app using modern Java.
It focuses on real-world developer needs, without diving deeply into theory or academics.
Links to relevant further reading are provided for those who are interested. 

The application is a customer relationship management (CRM) system for managing contacts. It features:

* A login screen to restrict access.
* A responsive layout with side navigation that works on desktop and mobile.
* A database for persistent data storage.
* A list view that can be sorted and filtered.
* A form to edit and add contacts.
* Data import from a REST API.
* A dashboard view.
* Cloud deployment.
* App installation on mobile and desktop.

== Tools and frameworks

The frameworks and tools used in the guide were chosen for two reasons: they are easy to use, and they are suitable for both learning and production use. 

On the *back end*, the application uses *https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot]*.
This eliminates most of the hassle of setting up and running a Spring-based app and lets you focus on your own code.
The main features you'll use are:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection[Dependency injection] to decouple components.
* https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa[Spring Data JPA] repositories to work with the database.
* https://spring.io/projects/spring-security[Spring Security] to handle access control.
* An embedded http://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat] server to serve the application.
* https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-spring-boot.html#using-boot-devtools[Spring Boot Developer Tools] to provide a smoother development experience.

Don't worry if you don't know what all of these are, we cover each individually as we go.

On the *front end*, the application uses *https://vaadin.com/[Vaadin]* 
This is an open-source Java web app framework that comes with:

* https://vaadin.com/components[A large library of UI components]. Each component has a Java API and you can customize the look and feel.
* A router for navigating between views.
* A powerful data-binding system for forms and lists.

== Why use Vaadin instead of Spring MVC and Thymeleaf, JSP or Freemarker?

Vaadin is an alternative to using Spring MVC and Thymeleaf, JSP or Freemarker when building web applications with Spring Boot. 

The main advantage of Vaadin are:

* Vaadin is designed for building interactive single-page apps (SPA). Spring MVC and templates are better suited for more static content.
* Vaadin offers a Java component API, allowing you to build the entire application in Java.
* Vaadin comes with a large https://vaadin.com/components[library of customizable UI components].
* Vaadin handles the communication between the server and the browser automatically, you don't need to write any JavaScript to update content dynamically.

== Why use Vaadin instead of REST and React or Angular?

Combining a Spring Boot based REST backend with a frontend framework like React or Angular is a popular way of building SPAs. Vaadin allows you to build similar app experiences with less effort. 

Advantages of using Vaadin:

* Faster development: you do not need to develop the backend and frontend separately.
* The entire application can be written in typesafe Java.
* Vaadin comes with a large https://vaadin.com/components[library of customizable UI components].
* Vaadin handles the communication between the server and the browser automatically, you don't need to write any JavaScript to update content dynamically.
* More secure: the Vaadin app runs on the server and doesn't expose application code or extra endpoints to the browser.

== Source code

You can find the full source code for this guide on https://github.com/vaadin-learning-center/crm-tutorial/[GitHub]. Each chapter is in a separate branch.
In addition, the individual chapters include links to download the code both before and after the changes in the chapter, so you can easily get your project working again, if something does go wrong. 
Each chapter has a link to the source code from the previous chapter so you can start the tutorial at any chapter.
