= Turning a Vaadin app into an installable PWA

In this chapter, we turn the completed CRM application into a progressive web application (PWA) so that users can install it. 

You can download the completed source code at the bottom. The code from the previous tutorial chapter can be found https://github.com/vaadin-learning-center/crm-tutorial/tree/10-login[here], if you want to jump directly into this chapter.

== What is a PWA?

The term PWA is used to describe modern web applications that offer a native app-like user experience. PWA technologies make applications faster, more reliable, and more engaging. PWAs can be installed on most mobile devices and on desktop when using supported browsers. They can even be listed in the Microsoft Store and Google Play Store. You can learn more about the underlying technologies and features in the https://vaadin.com/docs/flow/pwa/tutorial-pwa-introduction.html[Vaadin PWA documentation].

Two main components enable PWA technologies:

* `ServiceWorker`: A JavaScript worker file that controls network traffic and enables custom cache control.
* Web app manifest: A JSON file that identifies the web app as an installable app.

== Generating PWA resources

Vaadin provides the `@PWA` annotation that automatically generates the required PWA resources. 

Add the `@PWA` annotation to `MainLayout` as follows:

.`*MainLayout.java*`
[source,java]
----
@CssImport("./styles/shared-styles.css")
@PWA( <1>
    name = "VaadinCRM", <2>
    shortName = "CRM")  <3>
public class MainLayout extends AppLayout {
     ...
}
----
<1> The `@PWA` annotation tells Vaadin to create a `ServiceWorker` and a manifest file.
<2> `name` is the full name of the application for the manifest file.
<3> `shortName` should be short enough to fit under an icon when installed, and should not exceed 12 characters. 

=== Customizing the app icon

. Start by creating a new folder `src/main/webapp`.

. Create a new subfolder  `src/main/webapp/icons`and add your own icon image named `icon.png`. The image resolution should be 512 px x 512 px. This overrides the default image in the starter. 

You can use your own icon, or save the image below, by right clicking and selecting *Save Image*.

== Customizing the offline page

Vaadin creates a generic offline fallback page that displays when the application is launched offline. Replacing this default page with a custom page that follows your own design guidelines makes your app more polished. 

. Use the code below to create `offline.html` in the new `src/main/webapp`folder: 
+
.`*offline.html*`
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8"/>
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge"/>
  <title>Offline | Vaadin CRM</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/offline.css"> <1>
</head>
<body>

<div class="content">
  <img src="./images/offline.png" alt="VaadinCRM is offline" class="offline-image"/> <2>
  <h1>Oh deer, you're offline</h1>
  <p>Your internet connection is offline. Get back online to continue using Vaadin CRM.</p>
</div>
<script>
  window.addEventListener('online', location.reload);
</script> <3>
</body>
</html>
----
+
<1> The page loads a CSS file, offline.css. 
<2> The page displays an image, offline.png.
<3> The JavaScript snippet reloads the page if the browser detects that it's back online. 

. Create two new folders, `src/main/webapp/styles` and `src/main/webapp/images`.

. In the `styles` folder, create `offline.css` and add the following styles:
+
.`*offline.css*`
[source,css]
----
body {
    display: flex; <1>
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    font-family: sans-serif;
    color: #555;
}

.content {
    width: 80%;
}

.offline-image {
    width: 100%;
    margin: 4em 0px;
}
----
+
<1> Makes the page a flexbox that centers content horizontally.

. Add the following image (or use one of your own) to the `images` folder and name it `offline.png`.
+
image::offline.png[example offline image]

. Make the files available offline by adding them to the `@PWA` annotation in `MainLayout` as follows:
+
.`*MainLayout.java*`
[source,java]
----
@CssImport("./styles/shared-styles.css")
@PWA(
    name = "VaadinCRM",
    shortName = "VaadinCRM",
    offlineResources = { <1>
        "./styles/offline.css",
        "./images/offline.png"})
public class MainLayout extends AppLayout {
    ...
}
----
+
<1> `offlineResources` is a list of files that Vaadin will make available offline through the `ServiceWorker`.
+
WARNING: Even though the paths for the CSS files is identical in the Java file, `shared-styles.css` is loaded from `frontend/styles/shared-styles.css`, whereas `offline.css` is loaded from `src/main/java/webapp/styles/offline.css`. If you have trouble accessing files while offline, check that these files are in the correct folders. 

. Restart the app. On supported browsers, your will now see an install prompt that you can use to install the application: 
+

== Testing the offline page

Shut down the server in IntelliJ and refresh the browser (or launch the installed app). You should now see the custom offline page.

In the next chapter, we cover testing the application: both unit tests and in-browser tests.
