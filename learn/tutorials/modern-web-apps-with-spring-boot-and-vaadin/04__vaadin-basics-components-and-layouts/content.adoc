= Vaadin basics: building UIs with components and layouts


In the previous two tutorials, you learned to set up a Java development environment and to import and run a Maven-based Spring Boot project. 

In this chapter we introduce you to core Vaadin concepts and get our project ready for coding.

You can download the completed source code at the bottom. The code from the previous tutorial chapter can be found https://github.com/vaadin-learning-center/crm-tutorial/tree/01-project-import[here], if you want to jump directly into this chapter.

TIP: If you prefer to use a drag and drop editor to build the UI, check out the link:https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/vaadin-designer-tutorial[Vaadin Designer] version of this tutorial.

== Quick introduction to Vaadin
First, let's review a few of the core Vaadin concepts we'll be working with.

=== What is Vaadin? 

Vaadin is a Java framework for building web applications. It has a component-based programming model that allows you to build user interfaces.

=== Vaadin UI components
The Vaadin platform includes a https://vaadin.com/components[large library of UI components] that you can use as the building blocks of your application.


You create a new component by initializing a Java object. For instance, to create a `Button`, you write:

[source,java]
----
Button button = new Button("I'm a button");
----

=== Layouts
Layouts determine how components display in the browser window. The most common layout components are `HorizontalLayout`, `VerticalLayout`, and `Div`. The first two set the content orientation as horizontal or vertical, respectively, whereas `Div` lets you control the positioning with CSS.

You add components to layouts using the `add()`method.

`HorizontalLayout` and `VerticalLayout` provide methods to align items on both the primary and the cross axis. For instance, if you want all components, regardless of their height, to be aligned with the bottom of a `HorizontalLayout`, you can set the default alignment to `Alignment.END`:

[source,java]
----
Button button = new Button("I'm a button");
HorizontalLayout layout = new HorizontalLayout(button, new DatePicker("Pick a date"));


layout.setDefaultVerticalComponentAlignment(Alignment.END);
add(layout);
----

=== Events
You can add functionality to your application by listening to events, such as, click events from buttons, or value-change events from select components. 

This example adds the text "Clicked!" to the layout when the button is clicked. 

[source,java]
----
button.addClickListener(clickEvent -> 
add(new Text("Clicked!")));
----

=== Where's the HTML?
One unique Vaadin feature is that you can build web applications entirely in Java. This higher level of abstraction makes development more productive and debugging easier.

Vaadin also supports HTML-templates and customizing the code that runs in the browser, but in most cases you neednâ€™t worry about this. 

== Preparing the project
=== Defining packages

Our app has both UI and backend code. To keep our code organized, we need to define separate packages for each in the project structure.

To define packages:

. Right-click the `com.vaadin.tutorial.crm` package.
. Select *New > Package* and create a package named `com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui`.
. Repeat this process to create another package named `com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.backend`. 

+

. Drag `MainView` into the `ui` package. If IntelliJ asks you if you want to refactor the code, say yes.

+
Your project structure should now look like this:
+

=== Setting up the main layout
Next, we clean out unnecessary code and set up our main layout. 

To do this:

. Delete the content of `MainView` and replace it with the code shown below. This removes all unnecessary code and ensures that we start with a clean slate. 

+
.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
package com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui;

import com.vaadin.flow.component.orderedlayout.VerticalLayout;
import com.vaadin.flow.router.Route;

@Route("") <1>
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    public MainView() {
        
    }

}
----
<1> `@Route("")` maps the view to the root.

. Next, *delete* the following unnecessary files: 

+
** `GreetService.java`
** `frontend/styles/vaadin-text-field-styles.css`

. Verify that you are able to run your application. 

+
You should see an empty window in the browser, and no errors in the console.

Before we can start building the UI, we need data to work with. In the next chapter, we'll set up a database and populate it with test data.
