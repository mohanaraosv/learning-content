= Setting up a Java development environment


Before you can start developing your Java app, you need to install the necessary development tools and set up your development environment. 

TIP: You can skip to link:/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin/vaadin-basics-components-and-layouts[chapter 4] if you prefer to code using the online IDE.

For web app development in Java, you need a: 

* *Java Development Kit (JDK)*: This is the foundation of your Java development environment. It contains the various tools required to develop a working Java application. Chief among them are the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which allows you to run a Java application and the Java compiler.
* *Build/project management tool (Maven)*: We will use this to import our project into the IDE and install any dependencies the project needs to function.
* *Version control system (Git)*:  Git lets you track and manage your web application’s source code. For example, a correctly set-up Git repo would allow you to easily undo any app breaking mistakes. 
* *Front-end build tool (Node.js)*: Node.js is a JavaScript run-time environment (much like Java’s JRE). Vaadin uses Node internally to build an optimized version of your app.  
* *Integrated development environment (IDE)*: The IDE is the tool you use to write and run your code during development. 

You can complete this guide using any IDE, but for the sake of simplicity, we use https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ Idea] throughout. The IntelliJ Community Edition is free to use and a great choice if you don't already have an IDE setup. 

If you have the necessary tools installed on your computer, or if you prefer to code using the online IDE below, you can skip ahead to the link:/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin/vaadin-basics-components-and-layouts[Vaadin basics chapter].

== Which Java version should you install?
If you're new to Java or haven't used it in a while, you may be surprised by the number of Java runtimes available. A while ago, https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/update-and-faq-on-the-java-se-release-cadence[Oracle changed their release model] and made the official Oracle JDK a paid product for commercial projects. Instead of one major release every few years, they now release new major versions every 6 months, and designate a long-term support (LTS) version every 3 years. *We recommend you use the current LTS version, https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html[Java SE 11]*, if you prefer to use Oracle.

When the Oracle JDK became a commercial product, many developers chose to switch to alternative JDKs. There are many available drop-in replacements that are free to use and come with long-term-support releases. *We recommend you use either https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/[Amazon Corretto] or https://openjdk.java.net/[OpenJDK]*.

. Install Homebrew:
+
https://brew.sh/[Homebrew], is a package manager, and is the easiest way to install both Maven and Node on macOS. 
To install Homebrew, paste the following into your terminal:
+
----
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----

. Install Maven and Node:
+
Use this command to install both Maven and Node in Homebrew:
+
----
brew install node maven
----

. Install IntelliJ:
.. Go to the IntelliJ Mac https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac[download] page. 
.. Download the Community Edition installer . 
.. Copy the app to your Applications folder in Finder.

== Setting up on Linux

endif::[]

This section contains instructions for Debian and RPM-based distros. Installation on other distributions should be very similar and you can adapt these instructions, if necessary.  On Linux, it's easiest to use OpenJDK, as it's available in the package repositories. 

. Install Node.js:
+
NOTE: You need to install the latest Node.js LTS repository to your package manager. The version available in most distributions is not sufficiently new for our purposes. https://github.com/nodesource/distributions[Nodesource] offers packages for all major distros.


.. Debian-based systems:

... For Ubuntu and distributions using sudo, run:
+
----
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk maven git nodejs
----


... For Debian, or if you are not using sudo, run the following as root:
+
----
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | bash -
apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk maven git nodejs
----

.. RPM-based distributions, run:
+
----
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo yum install -y java-11-openjdk-devel.x86_64 maven git nodejs
----


... Check the Java version:
**** To ensure that you are running Java 11, run `java -version`. 

**** To change to change to Java 11, if necessary, use:
+
----
sudo alternatives --config java
----
+
NOTE: If you are on a different distro, or aren't comfortable with the automatic repo setup script, you can find a full set of instructions on the https://github.com/nodesource/distributions[NodeSource GitHub repository].


. Install IntelliJ:
+
TIP: The easiest way to install IntelliJ on Linux is to use the https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd[Snap package manager]. If you use Ubuntu or a derivative, it is already installed. 


.. To install IntelliJ using snap, run:
+
----
sudo snap install intellij-idea-community --classic
----


.. To install intelliJ manually:
... Go to the IntelliJ Linux https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux[download] page. 
... Download the Community Edition `.tar.gz`. 
... Extract the archive: 
+
----
sudo mkdir /opt/intellij
sudo tar zxvf ideaIC*.tar.gz -C /opt/intellij --strip-components=1
----
... Run the IDE (the start wizard gives you the option to create a desktop shortcut):
+
----
sh /opt/intellij/bin/idea.sh
----


You now have everything you need to start coding Java. The next tutorial will show you how to import and run a Maven-based Java project in IntelliJ.
